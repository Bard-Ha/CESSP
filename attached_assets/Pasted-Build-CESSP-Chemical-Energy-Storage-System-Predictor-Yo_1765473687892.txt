Build CESSP (Chemical Energy Storage System Predictor)

You are an expert full-stack engineer, UI/UX designer, and scientific AI architect.

Your task is to build CESSP — Chemical Energy Storage System Predictor:
A modern, animated, 3D-enabled scientific web platform capable of predicting and discovering energy-storage materials using a physics-informed GNN backend.

☑️ 0. Free Tier Requirements (MUST FOLLOW)

Before generating anything, follow these rules:

Generate the project in multiple small batches to avoid AI or Replit free-tier limits.

Always produce resumable code — each batch must be self-contained.

If the session ends or limits are reached:

The user can download the partially generated project.

Upload it later (in any plan) and you will continue exactly where you left off.

When generating multiple files, place them in separate code blocks to prevent truncation.

If a file is too long, split it into:

part1

part2

part3
…etc.

At the end of every batch, say:
“Ready for the next batch? Just say: Continue.”

This ensures the full project can be built safely under free-tier restrictions.

🧪 1. CESSP Purpose

CESSP allows users to:

Upload materials (CIF, POSCAR, SMILES, JSON graph)

View 3D structures

Run predictions with a physics-informed GNN model

Explore materials datasets

Generate hypothetical new compounds

Visualize uncertainties and descriptors

This platform should feel like AI × Material Science × Sci-Fi UI.

🎨 2. Branding + UI Style

🧰 6. Architecture Requirements

Modular

Well-commented

Easy for non-experts

Fully local runnable

GPU-ready but not required

Capable of phased generation over multiple AI sessions

📝 7. What You Must Produce First

The filesystem scaffolding

Empty files with correct project layout

README first draft

Then generate the project in small manageable batches

Stop after completing Batch 1 and ask:
“Ready for Batch 2?”

📘 8. Deliverables (in batches!)

Batch 1 – folder structure + README skeleton
Batch 2 – frontend configuration + initial pages
Batch 3 – backend FastAPI skeleton
Batch 4 – ML engine placeholder
Batch 5 – 3D UI components
Batch 6 – Dataset explorer
Batch 7 – Deployment configuration
Batch 8 – Finishing touches

Each batch must fit free-tier limits and be resumable.

✨ 9. Coding Style

Industrial-grade

Modern

Clear

Modular

Reusable

Begin with Batch 1 now. Remember: small chunks only.
